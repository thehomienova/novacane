      <div class="apple-description">
        <p>
          main benefits are 2x when using apple pay and 3x on apple products
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          this card has one of my favorite designs, stainless steel and minimal,
          truly representing apple. it sucks that you get 2% with apple pay but
          only 1% with the actual card.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          the cashback earned also goes into a high yield savings account that
          pays 3%-4% in interest. you can deposit more, on top of ur cash back,
          if u please. if you know me, you know i hate keeping cash in a regular
          checking or savings account and park most of my money in HYSA like
          apple's
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          given the value i can get from other cards, i really only use this one
          for apple purchases. i enjoy the interest free monthly installments
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          and if you use my referral link, you get $75 deposited into the
          savings accounts after u make ur first purchase.
        </p>
