        <p>main benefits are 1x on rent and 3x on dining</p>

        <p>
          this card is one of the best no annual fee cards out right now. no
          sign on bonus kinda sucked but still worth it since this is the only
          card that lets you earn points on rent without processing fees
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          i mainly use this for rent and food but you also get 2x on travel, 5x
          on lyft, and 1x everything else. you have to use the card at least 5
          times a month to be eligble for the 1x rent rewards
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          with great transfer partners, like hyatt, american airlines, and more!
          which is rare for a no annual fee card
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          and if you use my referral link, bilt gives you 5x points on
          everything for the first 5 days (excluding rent). i planned a big
          purchase shortly after getting approved to take advantage of the 5x
