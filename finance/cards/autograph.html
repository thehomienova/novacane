          this was one of my first cards, since i was a long wells fargo
          customer. i dont use as much anymore since i have other cards i prefer
          to use for the same, or more, return on spend.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          i still use this card occasionally when there's good offers on the
          card. like today there was an offer for 20% off gas, on top of the 3%
          earned points.
