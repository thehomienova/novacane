      <div class="discover-description">
        <p>main benefits are rotating 5% each quarter</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          this is a great beginner card. you get 5% on different categories
          every 3 months, usually solid options like gas or groceries or
          restaurants.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          i still use this card when i want some cashback instead of points and
          the category for the quarter fits into my spending.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          not to mention the fire sign on bonus. whatever you earn in the first
          year, they match. i think i earned $300 in my first year, so at the
          end of that year, they gave me another $300
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          and if you use my referral link, you get an additional $100 deducted
          from ur statement after ur first purchase
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          i also get a bonus if you use my link, so i appreciate the support
        </p>
