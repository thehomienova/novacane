      <div class="hyatt-description" style="color: white">
        <p>main benefits are a free night at a hyatt each year</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          this card carries a fee of $95/year. the reason i find the annual fee
          worth it is that i get a free stay each year at a category 1-4 hyatt
          stay, which can range from $200-$400 a night.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          you also get 9x at hyatt, 2x on dining / travel / transit, then 1x on
          everything else. the sign on bonus is a nic 30,000 points with 2x on
          everything on the first 15k purchases or first six months, whichever
          comes first.
        </p>
