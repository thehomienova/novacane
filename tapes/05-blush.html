            kevin abstract really just said "here's brockhampton 2" lol. <br />
            Blush feels like a summer fever, all over the place but warm.<br />
            his last tape had peaks but this one levitates you. <br />
            he finally gave us "red light" and "post break up beauty", two songs
            that lived in my head off leaks for soooo long. but they're real
            now! <br />
            aoty for me, idc what pitchfork says.

            summer school's been chill. <br />
            mostly i've been tweaking this site so that it looks pretty on both
            cracked iphones and wide ass desktops. <br />
            i got one of those DOT cards now. <br />
            i tap it on your phone and boom, you enter my lil universe. <br />
            i've started using the card on people so they can see the site
            themselves instead of just building in the dark.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            next step: <br />
            get people to come back <br />
            maybe a mailing list. maybe something better <br />
            i wanna send updates. like postcards from my brain. <br />
            updating them on a new blog drop so they can re-enter.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            also thinking of replacing the rickroll easter egg on mobile. <br />
            its funny but i'd rather have a google voice line that greets you,
            thanks you for visiting, and lets you leave a voicemail. <br />
            like a hotline to the blog. <br />
            say what you want. leave an echo.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            i still need to finish the investing page. <br />
            been meaning to talk more about my bets like robinhood and reddit,
            both up heavy since the tariff dip. <br />
            still learning, still watching the charts like they're
            constellations.

            my little sister turned 11 a few days ago. <br />
            she got birthday money, and i told her: <br />
            you play roblox all the time right? <br />
            what if instead of just being a customer and player, you could be an
            owner? <br />
            she lit up, excited to invest. <br />
            you love to see it. <br />
          </p>

            i've been slipping on my web development cirriculum. <br />
            this site's been my main sandbox but i know i gotta circle back,
            <br />
            learn deeper so i can build cooler.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            this whole thing, <br />
            this site, this world im building, <br />
            it started as an idea, <br />
            but now its coming to fruition, evolving.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            and if ur here, reading this... <br />
            thank you for listening. <br />
            even if its just you and me and the glow of a screen.
