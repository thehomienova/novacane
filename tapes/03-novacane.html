        <p>today i finally copped the domain.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          i was hyped af seeing how the blog looked on <i>my iphone</i> and
          <i>my laptop.</i> felt like, yeah it's time to take this shit
          <i>live.</i>but now i'm realizing i gotta tweak the structure + styles
          for every screen size. mobile responsiveness is my final boss fr. so
          tedious.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          touched a little grass today tho. took my sister to the park. i got
          philz, she got starbucks. caffeine-fueled coding grind all day after
          that. addicted to both coffee and this blog.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          also finally seeing a doctor tomorrow about my ears. years of loud
          concerts, zero protection. now im tryna see what damage i did.
          obviously i rock earplugs now for any enviroment my apple watch says
          is too loud.
        </p>

          me and my sister are hitting outside lands in august. her first
          festival and even she knows the drill at concerts about protection.
          but its my second concert of the year. wild how in 2023 i was at shows
          like twice a month.
