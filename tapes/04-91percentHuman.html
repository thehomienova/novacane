          i started summer break. <br />
          bombed my trig final with a D+. <br />
          turns out it was open notes and i didn't even know. smh. <br />
          still finished the class with a 91%. straight As this semester which
          means GPA is clean and my head is held high.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          i've been lazy since, not gonna lie. <br />
          no studying. barely reading. <br />but i've been working doubles and
          spending money like i got it lol.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          i just started reading no longer human by osamu dazai. <br />the way
          he talks about being a human, like it's some distant, fragile thing is
          so relateable. i've had times where i feel like i can't relate to
          these intellectual monkeys.
        </p>

        <p>
          i start summer school on monday so ima have to lawck een.
          <br />classes. the odin project. <br />headphones on, eyes on code,
          nothing else. i still need to finish this site. but responsive design
          hasn't come up yet in the curriculum, so maybe i wait. maybe i just
          breathe.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          i want to keep blogging tho. <br />
          i love screaming into the void with admiration towards life. this is
          my way of leaving marks on a piece of work thats my own.
