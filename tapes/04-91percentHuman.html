            i started summer break. <br />
            bombed my trig final with a D+. <br />
            turns out it was open notes and i didn't even know. smh. <br />
            still finished the class with a 91%. straight As this semester which
            means GPA is clean and my head is held high.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            i've been lazy since, not gonna lie. <br />
            no studying. barely reading. <br />but i've been working doubles and
            spending money like i got it lol.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            i just started reading no longer human by osamu dazai. <br />the way
            he talks about being a human, like it's some distant, fragile thing
            is so relateable. i've had times where i feel like i can't relate to
            these intellectual monkeys.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            i start summer school on monday so ima have to lawck een.
            <br />classes. the odin project. <br />headphones on, eyes on code,
            nothing else. i still need to finish this site. but responsive
            design hasn't come up yet in the curriculum, so maybe i wait. maybe
            i just breathe.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            i want to keep blogging tho. <br />
            i love screaming into the void with admiration towards life. this is
            my way of leaving marks on a piece of work thats my own.
