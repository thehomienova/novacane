          <p><b>congratulations</b> to the young boy who feared <br>
          who survived slammed doors and yelling <br>
          who survived his mother drowning in tears <br>
          who said goopdbye to his father for a chapter <br>
          i became a father figure to my fatherless sister <br>
          building a new home <br>
          when mine had been broken <br>
          i was lost <br>
          but at least a new album just dropped <br>
          and you sound perfect to me <br>
          <br>
          navigating foreign territory <br>
          with no masculine energy except my own <br>
          surroudned by loud telenovelas <br>
          and this album replaying on my phone <br>
          i know every meal i ate was made with love <br>
          and still <br>
          with all that leftover anger and thriving closeness <br>
          all i could breathe out was <br>
          <b>dang</b> <br>
          <br>
          even if my parents marriage couldnt <b>stay</b> <br>
          i knew this work of art would never leave me <br>
          and i hoped these women never would either <br>
          <br>
          playing with her blonde hair <br>
          while i played the album in order and followed its script <br>
          <b>skin</b> touching in the name of exploration, addicts <br>
          to each other's taste <br>
          <i>your divinity has turned me into a sinner</i> <br>
          so i didnt worship god in a church <br>
          but the feminine body was always worshipped in my bed <br>
          <br>
          unlike her father <br>
          who rejected her love yet kept her imprisoned <br>
          <i>daddy told you better bring your ass home</i> <br>
          my safe space wasnt the only one falling apart <br>
          in her heart, she knew she wanted to escape <br>
          and i needed one within my room <br>
          with a backpack and a midnight decision <br>
          she moved in under one condition <br>
          <i><b>Cinderella</b> better bring your ass home</i> <br>
          <br>
          my home was slowly being rebuilt <br>
          the waterfalls from my mother's eyes disappeared <br>
          i would educate my sister and make it clear <br>
          that i was here <br>
          for good <br>
          whenever i found myself <br>
          not good <br>
          i would teleport <br>
          to <b>planet god damn</b> <br>
          a planet of pure euphoria <br>
          with a frequency that flooded my ears like a tsunami <br>
          but i wasnt drowning <br>
          i was swimming <br>
          i found bliss, and when im in it <br>
          <i>i think you're too divine for my human mind</i> <br>
          stars were exploding, the moon smelled right <br>
          but all i could focus on was ur divinity <br>
          <br>
          <i>are you my soulmate</i> <br>
          i hear you on every drive <br>
          late night or sunrise <br>
          you heal me without a medical degree <br>
          <i>you the only thing for me in this fucked up world</i> <br>
          you decorate time with such beauty that i dont mind wasting it <br>
          i <br>
          dont <br>
          mind <br>
          my mother's annoying lectures that come packed with care <br>
          or my sister's silly questions that are woven with admiration <br>
          i <br>
          dont <br>
          mind <br>
          ruining my sleep schedule for shared laughter and unfolding intimacy <br>
          or curing a hangover that came from my drinking buddy, not the alcohol <br>
          i <br>
          dont <br>
          mind <br>
          just as the beats follow me around every corner <br>
          the divine feminine in the flesh is always nearby <br>
          <i>theres no more "you" and "me", we are "we", yes <b>we</b> are</i> <br>
          we are safe <br>
          we are fun <br>
          we are love <br>
          <br>
          <b>my favorite part</b> <br>
          is the way you sound after a long day of responsibilities <br>
          my favorite part <br>
          is how my mother checks in on me a million times a day, <br>
          constantly creating a home cooked meal that warms my soul <br>
          my favorite part <br>
          is how my sister still thinks im invincible, <br>
          always wanting to watch a movie with me <br>
          my favorite part <br>
          is how someone new showed me the divine feminine isnt just a memory <br>
          it's here, it's alive, taking a shot of tequila with me <br>
          <br>
          the divine feminine is my god <br>
          and <br>
          <b>god</b> <br>
          <b>is</b> <br>
          <b>fair</b> <br>
          <b>sexy</b> <br>
          <b>nasty</b> <br>
          i thank this album forever <br>
          etched into my memories <br>
          etched into my skin <br>

            at the ripe new age of 24 (#virgo), my body and i dont always see eye to eye.<br />
            i thrive off benders, off alcohol<br />
            feeling more &nbsp;  &nbsp;alive &nbsp;  &nbsp;   than ever<br />
            but my body's check engine light came on after i drank for 72 hours straight.<br />
            my people carried me tho <br>
            held me up as i stumbled <br>
            texted me to say <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;happy birthday<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;proving that my silly day mattered <br>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            to mark the year, i put the divine feminine by mac miller on my arm.<br />

            fittingly, my literary analysis class chose to focus on music + poetry <br>
            we've been reading delilah's daughter by kim davalos (beautiful fucking read) while writing
            our own poems around albums we love (guess which one i picked)<br>
            mine came out <br>
            <span class="divine-feminine-vulnerable">slightly vulernable </span> <br>
            <span class="divine-feminine-emotional">overly emotional</span> <br>
