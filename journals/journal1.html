      <p>Sometimes typing hurts less than talking</p>
      <p>
        Lately I’ve been living in this weird space between wanting to be alone and craving connection. Like I’ll turn my phone off to breathe for a second, but then get sad no one’s hitting me up. I think I’m just tired—tired of showing up for people who don’t ask how I’m doing back. This isn’t a cry for help, more like… a sigh typed out. The kind you let out when no one’s around, but you still hope someone hears it.
