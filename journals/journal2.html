      <p>welcome to my first blog. i have been working on it for the past week. i think im finally satisfied with the home page, the journals page,
        and the journal entries themselves. its mostly just structure and styles, no interactability yet. im still learning so things might break, new featurs will be added. this is fun. 
        this is mostly a way for me to track my progress in different areas of my life, publicly. as i learn more javascript, you'll see more life (no drake) on this site. as i build more 
        sites and feel more confident with them, i will also build a portfolio site. this marks the first journal entry i just started my compuer science degree this year while doing the 
        odin project (web dev curriculum) outside of my degree. ai might be taking our jobs but im excited nonetheless.
